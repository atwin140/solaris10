      <discussion>NIS/NIS+/yp files are part of the system's identification and authentication processes and are, therefore, critical to system security.  ACLs on these files could result in unauthorized modification, which could compromise these processes and the system.  </discussion>

      If the permissions include a "+", the file has an extended ACL and this is a finding.</check_content>
      <fix_text>Remove the extended ACL from the directory and files.
