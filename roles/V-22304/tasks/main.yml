      <title>The password hashes stored on the system must have been generated using a FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm.</title>
      <discussion>Systems must employ cryptographic hashes for passwords using the SHA-2 family of algorithms or FIPS 140-2 approved successors. The use of unapproved algorithms may result in weak password hashes more vulnerable to compromise.</discussion>
      <check_content>Determine if any password hashes stored on the system were not generated using a FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm.

      Procedure:
      # cut -d ':' -f2 /etc/passwd
      # cut -d ':' -f2 /etc/shadow

      If any password hashes are present not beginning with $5$ or $6$,  this is a finding.

      Verify that FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashing algorithms are available.
      # egrep '^[56]' /etc/security/crypt.conf
      If no lines are returned, this is a finding.</check_content>
      <fix_text>If the /etc/security/crypt.conf file does not support FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashing algorithms, upgrade to at least the Solaris 10 8/07 release.

      Edit the /etc/security/policy.conf file.
      # vi /etc/security/policy.conf
      Uncomment or add the CRYPT_ALGORITHMS_ALLOW line and set it to "5,6". Update the CRYPT_DEFAULT default line to be equal to 5 or 6. The following lines are acceptable.

      CRYPT_ALGORITHMS_ALLOW=5,6
      CRYPT_DEFAULT=6

      Update passwords for all accounts with non-compliant password hashes.</fix_text>
